        <h1>Bio</h1>
      </header>
      <p>A native of Charlotte, NC, I am a Senior UI Developer at Cardinal Solutions, which delivers full IT solutions to clients. I began her journey 8 years ago, pursuing a degree in Web Technologies with the intent of becoming a Web Designer. While in school, I discovered her passion for all things accessible and universally usable. Currently, I'm working to spread training and knowledge of accessibility by giving talks at meetups, internal training for my company and clients, and presenting at conferences.</p>
      <p>After graduating, I started out working in web design agencies and product development companies to design and develop websites, and have worked with both startups as well as corporations to develop products from sketch to launch.</p>
      <p>In addition to attending the Tech Talent South bootcamp as a student, I've also taught Intro to Web Design and Creation and tutored students, and continue to work with the community through co-organizing Charlotte Front End Developers, speaking at meetups, and presenting at conferences.</p>
      <p>Coding is basically my entire life, but when I'm not hacking, I'm writing fiction, playing synthesizer, or organizing events.</p>

        <dd>I worked the closing shift on Sundays at the Waterfowl Rescue, in which I was responsible for providing fresh food and water for the birds and putting them away at night. I was also occasionally responsible for acting as an assistant to a licensed rehabber during minor medical procedures. Sometimes, I was the only volunteer on duty for the duration of my shift and had to combat problems as they arose and make executive decisions for the birds' welfare. I learned how to be more self-sufficient and to act as a leader, and how to work with difficult birds.</dd>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Sarah has a wide variety of interests, many of which have helped her learn valuable soft skills in her day to day job. Some of her past hobbies have been:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Music - keyboard / synth player -- 2017</dt>
        <dd>Playing in a band and being a part of "weekend touring" taught me how to plan and organize shows, how to reach out to and discuss logistics with venues, and how to communicate weaknesses in the band. It also taught me how to work with a wide variety of personalities. Additionally, it helped me to further relax in front of large audiences and let go of perfectionism.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Music Journalism - Elevate Lifestyle and The Sound Faction -- 2012 - 2013</dt>
        <dd>As a music journalist, I not only honed my writing skills and put my work on public display, but I was also trained in how to conduct interviews with artists. I was in situations where I had to interface with bands I admired and had to know how to relax and keep my cool, and I learned how to effectively capture, document, and transcribe interviews into readable articles. I was also responsible for editing my own work, which was important since half of my articles were printed and couldn't be edited once they hit the publisher.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Beta reader / editor -- 2008 - 2012</dt>
        <dd>As a beta reader, writers sent me their works via email and I was responsible for coaching them through common errors in grammar, syntax, spelling, punctuation, and usage. Additionally, I worked to check for plot holes and plot devices, continuity in the story, and overall story flow / structure. Extensive editing and coaching helped me hone not only my written communication skills, but my soft skills in terms of offering critique, which has aided me in my role as a team lead today.</dd>
